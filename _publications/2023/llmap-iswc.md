tldr: An exploration of LLMs' application in ontology alignment.

abstract: >-
  This work investigates the applicability of recent generative Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the GPT series and Flan-T5, to ontology alignment for identifying concept equivalence mappings across ontologies. To test the zero-shot performance of Flan-T5-XXL and GPT-3.5-turbo, we leverage challenging subsets from two equivalence matching datasets of the OAEI Bio-ML track, taking into account concept labels and structural contexts. Preliminary findings suggest that LLMs have the potential to outperform existing ontology alignment systems like BERTMap, given careful framework and prompt design.
