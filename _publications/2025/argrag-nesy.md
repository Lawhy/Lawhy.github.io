tldr: RAG with argument graphs.

abstract: >-
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models by incorporating external knowledge, yet suffers from critical limitations in high-stakes domains—namely, sensitivity to noisy or contradictory evidence and opaque, stochastic decision-making. We propose \textsc{ArgRAG}, an explainable, and contestable alternative that replaces black-box reasoning with structured inference using a Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (QBAF). \textsc{ArgRAG} constructs a QBAF from retrieved documents and performs deterministic reasoning under gradual semantics. This allows faithfully explanaining and contesting decisions. Evaluated on two fact verification benchmarks, PubHealth and RAGuard, \textsc{ArgRAG} achieves strong accuracy while significantly improving transparency.
