tldr: Investigating KG-RAG performance breakdowns under incomplete knowledge

abstract: >-
    Knowledge Graphâ€“based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) is an increasingly
    explored approach for combining the reasoning capabilities of large language models
    with the structured evidence of knowledge graphs. However, current evaluation practices
    fall short: existing benchmarks often include questions that can be directly answered
    using existing triples in the knowledge graph, making it unclear whether models perform
    true reasoning or merely retrieval. This paper provides empirical insights into how
    incomplete knowledge in the KG affects KG-RAG reasoning performance, identifying
    weaknesses and proposing directions for building more robust benchmarks.
