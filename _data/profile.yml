  <p>
    I will join Amazon Rufus as an Applied Scientist in May 2025. I am also an academic visitor at both University of Oxford and CAMEL-AI.org. Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral Research Associate in the Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) group at the Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford, where I also obtained my PhD (DPhil) degree. 
  </p>

  <p>
    My research centers on Natural Language Processing, Knowledge Engineering, and Deep Learning, with a particular focus on rethinking how knowledge and reasoning are represented and leveraged in the era of large language models.
