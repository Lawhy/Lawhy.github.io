    I am currently a postdoctoral Research Associate in the Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) group at the Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford.
  </p>

  <p>
    My research interests revolve around Natural Language Processing, Knowledge Engineering, and Deep Learning, currently with the following specific topics:

    <ul>
    <li>Large Language Models for Knowledge Engineering</li>
    <li>Large Language Model Hallucinations and Interpretability</li>
    <li>Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Large Language Models</li> 
    <li>Geometric Language Models</li>
    </ul>

    I am also the main contributor of  several packages and resources, notably: <a href="https://krr-oxford.github.io/DeepOnto/">DeepOnto</a>, <a href="https://krr-oxford.github.io/OAEI-Bio-ML/">OAEI Bio-ML</a>, and <a href="https://huggingface.co/Hierarchy-Transformers">HierarchyTransformers</a>.
