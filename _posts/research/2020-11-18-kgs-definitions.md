Notes on reading the long survey: **Knowledge Graphs** (see References).

1. **Knowledge Graph**

    A graph of data intended to accumulate and convey knowledge of the real world, whose nodes represent `entities` of interest and whose `edges` represent relations between these entities.


2. **Interpretation**

    Mapping the nodes and edges in the `data graph` to those (respectively) of the `domain graph`.


3. **Model**

    The interpretations that satisfy a graph are called `models` of the graph.


4. **Entailment**

    One graph `entails` another *iff* any model of the former graph is also a model of the latter graph.
    
5. **Graph Pattern**

    Data graphs allowing `variables` as terms.
    
6. **Inference Rules**

    A rule encodes `IF-THEN` style consequences and is composed of a `body` (IF) and a `head` (THEN), both of which are given as `graph patterns`.

7. **Materialisation**

    Refers to the idea of applying `rules` *recursively* to a graph, adding the `conclusions` generated back to the graph until a fixpoint is reached and nothing more can be added.

8. **Query Rewriting**

    Automatically `extends` the query in order to find solutions entailed by a set of `rules`.

9. **Description Logics**

    DLs are based on three types of elements: `individuals` (e.g. Santiago); `classes` (e.g. City); and `properties` (e.g. flight). DLs then allow for making claims, known as `axioms`, about these elements. Assertional axioms form the `Assertional Box` (A-Box); Class axioms form the `Terminology Box` (T-Box); Property axioms form the `Role Box` (R-Box). `‚ä§` symbol is used in DLs to denote the `class of all individuals`.
    
10. **Deductive vs. Inductive**

    Deductive knowledge is characterised by `precise logicial consequences`; Inductive knowledge involves `generalising pattern`s (then `making predictions` with a level of confidence) from observations.
    
11. **Supervised, Self-supervised and Unsupervised Methods**

    `Supervised` methods learn a function (model) to map a given set of example inputs to their labelled outputs; `Self-supervisision` rather finds ways to generate the input-output pairs automatically from the input, then fed into a supervised process to learn a model; `Unsupervised` processes do not require lablled input-output pairs, but rather apply a predefined function to map inputs to outputs.
    
12. **Graph Analytics**

    `Analytics` is the process of discovering, interpreting, and communicating *meaningful patterns* inherent to data collections (graph data for Graph Analytics). `Topology` of the graph is how the nodes of the graph are connected.
    
    12.1 <u>Main techniques</u>: `Centrality` aiming to identify the most important nodes or edges of the graph. `Community detection` aiming to identify *communities*, i.e. sub-graphs that are more densely connected internally than to the rest of the graph; `Connectivity` aiming to estimate how well-connected the graph is, revealing, e.g. the resilience and (un)reachability of elements of the graph; `Node similarity` aiming to find nodes that are similar to other nodes by virtue of how they are connected within their neighbourhood; `Path finding` aiming to find paths in a graph, typically between pairs of nodes given as input.
    
    12.2 <u>Graph parallel frameworks</u> apply a `systolic abstraction` where nodes are processors that can send message to other nodes along edges; an algorithm in this framework consists of the functions to compute message values in the `message phase` (MsG), and to accumulate the messages in the `aggregation phase` (AGG); additional features including `global step` (global computation) and `mutation step` (adding/removing during processing).

    12.3 <u>Analytics involving edge meta-data</u>: `Projection` drops all edge metat-data; `Weighting` converts edge meta-data into numerical values according to some function; `Transformation` involves transforming the graph to a lower arity model, where being `lossy` means irreversible transformation (lossing information) and being `lossless` means reversible; `Customisation` involves changing the analytical procedure to incorporate edge meta-data.
    
    **Note**: The combination of analytics and entailment, according to the survey, has not been well-explored.
    
13. **Knowledge Graph Embeddings**

    **Embedding** is given by some mathematical function \\(f: X \rightarrow Y\\) which is `injective`, `structure-preserving` and often maps from the abstract high dimensional space to the concrete low diemnsional space to resolve the *sparsity* and *fractured information* caused by one-hot encoding. Here $$X$$ is said to be embedded in $$Y$$. The main goal is to create a dense representation of teh graph in a continuous, low-dimensional vector space, where the dimensionality *d* is typically low, e.g. \\(50 \leq d \leq 1000 \\). 
    
    13.1 <u>Most common instantiation</u> is given an edge \\([s] \xrightarrow{p} [o] \\), and the embeddings \\(e_s, r_p, e_o\\) (*e* stands for entity, *r* stands for relation), the scoring function computes the *plausibility* of the edge. The goal is then to compute the embeddings that maximise the plausibility of `postive edges` (typically edges in the graph) and minimise the plausibility of `negative examples` (typically edges in the graph with a node or edge label changed) according to the scoring function. The resulting embeddings can be seen as encoding latent features of graph through `self-supervision`, mapping input edges to output plausibility scores.
    
    13.2 <u>Translational models</u> interpret edge labels as transformations from subject nodes (source, head) to object nodes (target, tail). The most elementary approach is `TransE`, aiming to make \\(e_s + r_p \rightarrow e_o\\) for positive edges \\([s] \xrightarrow{p} [o] \\), and keeps the sum away from \\(e_o\\) for negative examples. `TransE` tends to assign cyclical relations a zero vector as the directional components will tend to cancel each other out. Variants of TransE such as `TransH` (represents different relations using distinct hyperplanes, so project the \\([s]\\) onto the hyperplane of \\(\xrightarrow{p}\\) before translating to \\([o]\\)), `TransR` (projects \\([s], [o]\\) into a vector space specific to \\(\xrightarrow{p}\\), `TransD` (simplifies TransR by associating entities and relations with a second vector, where these secondary vectors are used to project the entity into a relation-specific vector space).
    
    13.3 <u>Tensor decomposition models</u>: the original tensor is decomposed into more *elementary* tensors which capture *latent factors* (underlying information). `Rank decomposition` such that \\(\sum^r_{i=1} \mathbf{x_i} \otimes \mathbf{y_i} = \mathbf{C} \\) is approximated by setting a limit \\( d < r\\), \\(\otimes\\) refers to the `outer product` of vectors (\\(\mathbf{x} \otimes \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{x}\mathbf{y^T}\\). Method is called `Canonical Polyadic` (CP) decomposition. For graphs, we can have it encoded as a one-hot, order-3 tensor \\(G\\) with \\(\vert V \vert \times \vert L \vert \times \vert V \vert \\) elements, where \\(G_{ijk}\\) is set to one if \\(i^{th}\\) node links to \\(k^{th}\\) node with an edge having \\(j^{th}\\) label, or zero otherwise. Apply CP we obtain \\( \sum^d_{i=1} \mathbf{x_i} \otimes \mathbf{y_i} \otimes \mathbf{z_i} \approx G\\) and the decomposed \\(\mathbf{x_i}, \mathbf{y_j}, \mathbf{z_k}\\) are the graph embeddings we want. 
    
    **Note**: According to the survey, the current state-of-the-art decomposition method is `TuckER` with \\( G = \mathcal{T} \otimes \mathbf{A} \otimes \mathbf{B} \otimes \mathbf{C}\\), where the tensor \\(\mathcal{T}\\) is the "core" tensor.
    
    13.4 <u>Neural models</u>: One of the earliest proposal is `Semantic Matching Energy` (SME) which learns parameters for two functions such that \\(f_s(e_s, r_p) \cdot g_{w'}(e_o, r_p)\\) gives the plausibility score; Anoter early work was `Neural Tensor Networks` (NTN), which proposes to maintain a tensor \\(\mathcal{W}\\) of internal weights such that the plausibility score is given by a complex function that combines \\(e_s \otimes \mathcal{W} \otimes e_o \rightarrow NN_{e_s}, NN_{e_o} \rightarrow r_p\\). `Multi-layer Perceptron` (MLP) is a simpler model, where \\(e_s, r_p, e_o\\) are concatenated and fed into a hidden layer to compute plausibility score. For more neural models, please refer to page 41 - 42 of the survey.
    
    13.5 <u>Language models</u>: `RDF2Vec` performs biased random work on the graph and records the paths as *sentences*, which are then fed as input to `word2vec` model. `KGloVe` uses personalised PageRank to determine the most related nodes to a given node, whose results are fed into the `GloVe` model.
    
    13.6 <u>Entailment-aware models</u>: Use deductive knowledge (ontology, set of rules) to refine the predictions made by embeddings.

14. **Graph Neural Network**

    14.1 <u>Recursive GNN</u> (RecGNN) takes as input a directed graph where nodes and edges are associated with `feature vectors` that capture node and edge labels, weights, etc. Each node is associated with `state vecotr`, which is recursively updated based on neighbours, with convergence up to a fixpoint.
    
    14.2 <u>Convolutional GNN</u> (ConvGNN) has its transition function applied over a node and its neighbours, while for CNN it is appliedon a pixel and its neighbours in the image. One challenge is that neightbours of different nodes can be diverse and approaches to address that involves `spectral` or `spatial` representations. An alternative is to use `attention mechanism` to learn the nodes whose features are most important to the current node.
    
15. **Symbolic Learning**

    Previous neural approaches are unable to provide results for edges involving unseedn nodes or edges (`out-of-vbocabulary` problem) and the models are often difficult to explain. `Symbolic learning` aims to learn *hypotheses* in a symbolic (logical) language that "explain" a given set of postive and negative edges.
    
    15.1 <u>Rule mining</u>: The goal is to identify new rules that entail a high ratio of `positive edges` from other positive edges, but entail a low ratio of negative edges from positive edges. Edges entailed by a rule and a set of positivbe edges are the `positive entailments` of that rule. The `number` and the `ratio` of positive entailments are `support` and `confidence` for the rule (good for high support and confidence). Under the `Partial Completeness Assumption` (PCA), negative examples are edges (\\([s] \xrightarrow{p} [o'] \\)) *NOT* in the graph but \\(\exists [o]. [s] \xrightarrow{p} [o]\\). Edges that are neither positive or negative are ignored by the measure. Rules are `closed` meaning that each variable appears in `at least two edges` of the rule, which ensures rules are `safe`, meaning that each variable in the `head` appears in the `body` (see Definition 6 for the concept of head and body). Technique that involves NN is called `differentiable rule mining`.
    
    15.2 <u>Axiom mining</u>: Axioms are expressed in logicial languages such as DLs.
    
16. **Text Sources**

    16.1 <u>Pre-processing</u> includes `Tokenisation`, `Part-of-Speech tagging`, `Depdency Parsing` (extracts a grammatical tree structure), `Word Sense Disambiguation` (to identify sense and link words with a lexicon of senses, e.g. WordNet).
    
    16.2 <u>Named Entity Recognition</u>: Names entities identified by NER may be used to generate new candidate nodes from the KG, or linked to exsisting nodes.
    
    16.3 <u>Entity Linking</u>: Challenging because \\([1]\\) there are multiple ways to mention the same entity and \\([2]\\) the same mention in different contexts can refer to distinct entities.
    
    16.4 <u>Relation Extraction</u>: The RE task extracts relations between entities in the text.
