excerpt: >-
    Before specialising in the field of Computer Science, I had a 10-year experience of writing in Chinese literature under the pseudonym “知陌若”. My works include proses, poems and novels, which nearly cover all the possible literal styles in Chinese. I have selected some representative works to be displayed on this website. Apart from writing, I am also fiercely into musical composition and singing. There are two pieces of my composition works created using Sibelius.

Before specialising in the field of Computer Science, I had a 10-year experience of writing in Chinese literature under the pseudonym “知陌若”. My works include proses, poems and novels, which nearly cover all the possible literal styles in Chinese. The link to my cherished literature chest is available [here](https://user.qzone.qq.com/619500985?ADUIN=619500985&ADSESSION=1606090056&ADTAG=CLIENT.QQ.5779_MyTip.0&ADPUBNO=27063&source=namecardhoverstar). I have selected some representative works to be displayed on this website.

Apart from writing, I am also fiercely into musical composition and singing. There are two pieces of my composition work created using *Sibelius* available [here](https://github.com/Lawhy/MusicPieces).
