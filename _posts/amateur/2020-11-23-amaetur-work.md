Before specializing in the field of Computer Science, I had a 10-year experience of writing in Chinese literature under the pseudonym "知陌若". 
My works include proses, poems and novels, which nearly cover all the possible literal styles in Chinese.
The link to my cherished literature chest is available [here](https://user.qzone.qq.com/619500985?ADUIN=619500985&ADSESSION=1606090056&ADTAG=CLIENT.QQ.5779_MyTip.0&ADPUBNO=27063&source=namecardhoverstar). 
In the future, I will select some of the old works and write the new works to display in this section. 

Apart from the writing, I am also fiercely into the musical composition and singing. 
There are two pieces of my composition work created using *Sibelius* available [here](https://github.com/Lawhy/MusicPieces).
